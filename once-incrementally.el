;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Provides helpers for incrementally deferring code to run spread out during
;; idle time like Doom's :defer-incrementally.  This package is based on Doom's
;; code but does not depend on Doom and provides additional functionality such
;; as allowing giving packages priority (as a number like `add-hook') and
;; incrementally running any code not just requiring packages (which could
;; potentially be useful over just using `run-with-idle-timer').

;; For more information see the README in the online repository.

(require 'cl-lib)

(require 'once-core)

(defcustom once-idle-timer 2.0
  "How long (in idle seconds) to wait before running code.
This applies just after startup and after incremental loading is interrupted by
user input.  When nil, do not incrementally load or run anything.  When 0,
immediately run all code after startup.  For example, you could set this to
\"(if (daemonp) 0 2.0)\" to immediately run all code when starting the Emacs
daemon."
